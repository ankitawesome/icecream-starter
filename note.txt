you have to do three main work here:

download the zip from the link and obviously you need to navigate to this folder 

1.) npm install
2.) open two terminal shells and run these commands
            -- 1 : npm run watch  (keep watching files for potential change)
            -- 2 : npm run dev    (keep running server with nodemon server.js)
